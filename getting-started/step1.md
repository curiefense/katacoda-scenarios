## Deploy Curiefense

To speed things up we already grabbed the latest code from GitHub

`git clone https://github.com/curiefense/curiefense.git`

At the moment, we are running the following command in the background* (it should take ~40 seconds):

`cd curiefense/deploy/compose/ && docker-compose up`

Once you see "Configured ðŸŽ‰" you now have Curiefense running! Lets continue to Step 2.

* Feel free to go to the next step while Curiefense configures.
