👋 Welcome! Thanks for your interest in Curiefense. This learning platform will allow you to explore what Curiefense can do without needing to install anything. 🥳

**In this lesson we will cover Tag Rules:**

Tag Rules lists attach tags to requests and sessions based on various criteria, from matching headers, cookies, arguments or URLs to traffic sources such as geolocations, IP addresses, CIDRs, and AS numbers. Subsequently, the tags are then used to make decisions about how the requests are handled.

Steps:
1. Launch Curiefense Management UI
1. Create a Tag Rules list
1. Test our configuration 
1. Review the Access Logs in Kibana

See you at the finish line. 🏁
